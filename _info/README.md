## Organization

This project is organized into three main folders:

- client
- server
- storage

The `client` folder contains the client-side view and controller.

The `server` folder contains three options for running the 
server-side controller / API (Node.js, Python, and PHP). 

Note: The Python and PHP controllers / APIs are not yet added, 
they will be completed after the main Node.js controller is completed.

The `storage` folder contains information to help create a MySQL
database with all necessary tables, as well as some sample data
to play with.

## Recommended Setup

This application was built with the intent to use Nginx as a 
reverse proxy for the Node.js API, but Apache may be used 
instead. 

Note: Instructions on how to set up the server and its 
configuration files will be added upon completion of this 
application.
